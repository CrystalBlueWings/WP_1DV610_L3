# Test Plan and Test Specification

## Test Strategy

The app will be tested both manually and automatically:

- **Manual Testing**: The user interface will be tested by performing specific tasks, e.g., starting a new puzzle, using solver functions, and providing hints.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests with Jest framework for the Sudoku solver and functionalities directly tied to the module.
- **Negative Testing**: Error handling will be tested by inputting invalid values or performing illogical actions.

### Results (!!! Preliminary results. Update later. !!!)

| **Test Case** | **Status** | **Comment**                                  |
|---------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **TC1**       | OK         | New puzzles are generated and displayed correctly for all difficulty levels ("Easy", "Medium", "Hard").          |
| **TC2**       | OK         | NUsers can interact with empty cells using mouse and keyboard. Only numbers 1-9 are accepted in empty cells.              |
| **TC3**       | OK         | "Solve Puzzle" button works as expected, solving the puzzle and displaying the solution.  |
| **TC4**       | OK         | "Get Hint" button provides correct hints when cells are empty. Displays appropriate message when no hints are available or puzzle is complete.     |
| **TC5**       | OK         | Input is rejected when entering invalid characters; only numbers 1-9 are accepted. Error handling works as per the specification.|
| **TC6**       | OK         | "Reset Puzzle" resets the puzzle to its initial state as expected, regardless of the current state of the puzzle.|
| **TC7**       | OK         | "Check Solution" displays correct messages when the puzzle is solved correctly and when it is unsolved or contains conflicts.|
| **TC8**       | OK         | Keyboard navigation between cells works as expected using arrow keys. Users can move focus across the grid seamlessly.|
| **TC9**       | OK         | Uneditable cells cannot be modified by the user. Attempting to change their values has no effect, maintaining the integrity of the initial puzzle.|
| **TC10**       | OK         | Editable and uneditable cells are visually distinct, with uneditable cells displayed in grey and non-interactive, and editable cells displayed in blue and interactive.|

### Analysis

#### Functional Testing

    Puzzle Generation: The application successfully generates new puzzles for each difficulty level. Each new puzzle presents a different configuration, ensuring variety and replayability.
    User Interaction: Users can interact with the puzzle grid using both the mouse and keyboard. The input is restricted to valid numbers (1-9), enhancing user experience and preventing errors.
    Solver Functions: The "Solve Puzzle" feature works correctly, providing solutions to the puzzles. The "Get Hint" feature offers useful hints, aiding users who may be stuck.
    Error Handling: The app effectively handles invalid inputs, preventing users from entering letters, symbols, or numbers outside the range of 1-9. Appropriate messages are displayed when actions cannot be performed.
    Reset and Check Solution: The "Reset Puzzle" function restores the puzzle to its original state. The "Check Solution" feature accurately assesses whether the puzzle is solved correctly.

#### User Experience

    Visual Feedback: The application provides clear visual cues. Editable cells are blue and interactive, while uneditable cells are grey and non-interactive. This distinction helps users understand which cells they can modify.
    Keyboard Navigation: Users can navigate the grid using arrow keys, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.
    Responsive Design: The interface responds smoothly to user actions, with immediate feedback on inputs and commands.

#### Stability and Performance

    The application is stable with no crashes or unexpected behavior observed during testing.
    Performance is smooth, with quick responses to user inputs and function executions.

#### Areas for Improvement
